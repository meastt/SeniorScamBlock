## Next Steps for Production

### 1. AI Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Option A: OpenAI Integration (Recommended)
```typescript
// File: src/services/scamDetection.ts
// Add environment variable for API key

import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

const OPENAI_API_KEY = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('openai_key');

export const analyzeMessageWithAI = async (messageContent: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: `You are a scam detection expert helping seniors identify scams. 
                   Analyze messages and respond with:
                   1. Risk level: RED (definite scam), YELLOW (suspicious), or GREEN (appears safe)
                   2. One simple sentence explanation (max 12 words)
                   3. Detailed explanation for "Tell Me More" button
                   4. Scam type if detected`
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: messageContent
        }
      ],
      temperature: 0.3, // Lower temperature for consistent results
      max_tokens: 500,
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  // Parse and return ScamAnalysisResult
};
```

**Cost Estimate**: ~$0.002-0.005 per message check with GPT-4

#### Option B: Custom ML Model
- Train on scam dataset
- Deploy to AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI
- Lower long-term costs
- More control over detection logic

### 2. Payment Integration (REQUIRED FOR PREMIUM)

#### Stripe Integration
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

```typescript
// File: src/services/payments.ts
import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

export const initiatePremiumSubscription = async () => {
  // 1. Create customer on backend
  // 2. Create subscription
  // 3. Handle payment method
  // 4. Update user subscription status
};
```

**Monthly Pricing**: $8.99/month
**Stripe Fee**: ~3% + $0.30 per transaction

### 3. Push Notifications (PREMIUM FEATURE)

#### Family Alerts
```typescript
// File: src/services/notifications.ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export const sendFamilyAlert = async (familyMembers, alertData) => {
  // Send push notification to family members
  // "⚠️ Scam detected: Your parent blocked 1 scam today"
};
```

**Setup Required**:
- Expo Push Notification service
- FCM (Android) / APNs (iOS) configuration

### 4. Auto-Monitor Feature (PREMIUM)

#### SMS/iMessage Monitoring (iOS)
- Requires Message Filter Extension
- Complex implementation
- Apple review required

#### Alternative: Share Extension
```typescript
// Easier implementation
// User shares message to app instead of auto-monitor
// Still provides quick access
```

### 5. Backend Infrastructure

#### Recommended Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (user data, subscriptions, history)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 (if storing message samples)
- **Hosting**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Railway

#### Required Endpoints
```
POST /api/analyze - Analyze message
GET  /api/history - Get user's check history
POST /api/subscribe - Create premium subscription
GET  /api/family - Get family members
POST /api/family - Add family member
DELETE /api/family/:id - Remove family member
GET  /api/alerts - Get weekly alert summary
```

### 6. Data Privacy & Security

#### CRITICAL Requirements
- [ ] Encrypt message content at rest
- [ ] Don't store full message content (only first 200 chars)
- [ ] Family members see alerts ONLY, not messages
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance
- [ ] Clear privacy policy
- [ ] Data deletion on account closure

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Use expo-secure-store for sensitive data
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Encrypt before saving
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('user_data', encryptedData);
```
