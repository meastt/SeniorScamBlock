HOW IT WORKS:

Someone calls pretending to be your grandchild in desperate trouble. They sound panicked and beg for money right away for bail, medical bills, car repairs, or legal fees.

These criminals are clever - they might say "Hi Grandma, it's me!" and wait for YOU to say a name like "Tommy? Is that you?" Now they know who to pretend to be.

They create a believable story: arrested while traveling, in a car accident, or robbed abroad. They'll sound emotional - crying, upset, scared - to cloud your judgment.

The caller might even have a "lawyer" or "police officer" get on the phone to make it seem more real.

WARNING SIGNS:

• Unexpected call from grandchild "in trouble"
• Begs you not to tell their parents
• Demands immediate payment
• Wants gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency
• Creates extreme urgency and fear
• Background noise to disguise voice
• Claims their phone is broken (excusing different number)

WHAT TO DO:

1. STOP and BREATHE - Don't let panic take over

2. HANG UP immediately - Even if it seems rude

3. CALL your grandchild on their normal cell phone number

4. CALL their parents to check if everything is okay

5. DO NOT send any money until you verify the story

6. TRUST your instincts - If something feels wrong, it probably is

REAL STORY:

Martha from Ohio got a call: "Grandma, I'm in jail in Mexico. Please don't tell Mom, she'll be so upset. I need $5,000 for bail right now." She almost sent the money via Western Union until she hung up and called her grandson. He answered from his college dorm - perfectly safe!

REMEMBER:

Real emergencies CAN wait 10 minutes for you to verify the story. Any grandchild who truly loves you would rather wait than have you send money to a criminal. If they pressure you to act immediately without verification, it's 100% a scam.

HOW IT WORKS:

You receive a threatening call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare, FBI, or local police. They use official-sounding language and badge numbers to seem legitimate.

The scammer creates fear by saying:
• Your Social Security number has been suspended
• You owe back taxes and will be arrested
• Your Medicare benefits will be cancelled
• There's a warrant for your arrest
• Your bank account will be seized

They pressure you to pay immediately via gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency to "resolve" the issue. Some even instruct you to stay on the phone while you go to the store to buy gift cards.

WARNING SIGNS:

• Threatening phone call from "government agency"
• Demands immediate payment to avoid arrest
• Asks for gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency
• Requests your Social Security number or bank info
• Says you can't hang up or the police will come
• Caller ID shows government agency (easily faked)
• Claims your benefits are suspended
• Threatens legal action within hours

WHAT TO DO:

1. HANG UP IMMEDIATELY - Don't engage or argue

2. DO NOT call back the number they provide

3. Look up the REAL agency phone number online or from official mail

4. Call the real agency using the number YOU found

5. NEVER share your Social Security number over the phone

6. Report the scam to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov

REAL STORY:

Robert received a call from "Officer Johnson" saying his Social Security number was linked to criminal activity in Texas. The "officer" said Robert needed to verify his identity by providing his full SSN and then buy $3,000 in iTunes gift cards to "secure his account." Robert hung up and called the real Social Security office - they confirmed it was a scam and his account was fine.

IMPORTANT FACTS:

• The IRS ALWAYS sends letters first, never calls
• Social Security NEVER suspends your number
• Government agencies NEVER accept gift cards as payment
• Real agencies WON'T threaten immediate arrest over the phone
• You CAN hang up - it's not obstruction of justice

REMEMBER:

The government doesn't work this way. Real government agencies send official letters through postal mail and give you time to respond. They have formal processes and never demand gift cards or cryptocurrency. If you're unsure about any government matter, visit the local office in person or call using a number from official documentation.

    title: 'Phishing (Fake Emails)',
    scamType: 'Phishing',
    readTime: 3,
    content: `
HOW IT WORKS:

You receive an email or text message that looks exactly like it's from your bank, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, or another company you trust. It uses their logo, colors, and professional language to trick you.

The message creates panic: "Your account has been locked due to suspicious activity" or "Your payment method failed - update now or lose access." It includes a link that looks real but actually sends you to a fake website designed to steal your information.

These fake websites look identical to the real thing. When you enter your username and password, the criminals capture it and can now access your real account.

WARNING SIGNS:

• Urgent language: "Act now!" or "Within 24 hours"
• Generic greeting: "Dear Customer" instead of your name
• Suspicious sender email (look closely at the address)
• Spelling or grammar mistakes
• Asks you to click a link to "verify" information
• Requests password, Social Security number, or credit card
• Too good to be true offers or prizes
• Says your account will be closed if you don't act

WHAT TO DO:

1. DO NOT click any links in suspicious emails or texts

2. DO NOT download any attachments

3. DO NOT enter passwords on websites you reached via email

4. HOVER over links (on computer) to see the real web address

5. GO directly to the company's website by typing the address yourself

6. CALL the company using the phone number on your credit card or statement

7. DELETE the suspicious email

8. REPORT it to the real company (many have fraud@companyname.com)

REAL STORY:

Susan received an email that looked exactly like it was from her bank, complete with their logo. It said unusual activity was detected and to click to verify her account. She almost clicked but noticed the sender email was "securityalert@bank-verify.com" instead of her bank's real domain. She called her bank directly - they confirmed it was a phishing scam and her account was safe.

HOW TO STAY SAFE:

• Never click links in emails asking for account information
• Type website addresses yourself - don't use links in emails
• Real companies don't email asking for passwords
• Check sender email addresses carefully
• When in doubt, call the company directly
• Keep your computer security software updated
• Use different passwords for different accounts

REMEMBER:

Legitimate companies will NEVER ask you to verify your password, credit card, or Social Security number via email or text. They already have this information! If there's truly a problem with your account, you'll see it when you log in directly by typing the web address yourself.

    title: 'Romance Scam',

    readTime: 4,
    content: `
HOW IT WORKS:

A charming person contacts you on Facebook, a dating site, or through email. They seem perfect - kind, attentive, shares your interests, and says the right things. They build a deep emotional connection over weeks or months through messages, calls, and sometimes video chats.

Once trust is established, a crisis emerges: they need money for a medical emergency, travel to visit you, business opportunity, or helping a sick relative. The requests start small but escalate. When you send money, another crisis always follows.

These criminals often target widows and widowers, using professional photos (stolen from real people) and scripted romantic messages. Some operate from overseas as part of organized crime rings.

WARNING SIGNS:

• Met online, never in person
• Professes deep love very quickly (within weeks)
• Claims to be military deployed overseas, engineer on oil rig, or working abroad
• Profile seems too good to be true
• Can't video chat (camera always broken) or uses excuses
• Plans to meet but always cancels at last minute
• Asks for money for emergencies: medical bills, travel, business deal
• Wants gift cards, wire transfer, cryptocurrency, or sending cash
• Asks you to receive packages and mail them elsewhere
• Gets angry or guilt-trips when you hesitate to send money

WHAT TO DO:

1. STOP all communication immediately

2. DO NOT send any more money

3. SAVE all messages, emails, and evidence

4. TELL a trusted family member or friend (don't be embarrassed)

5. REPORT to the dating site, social media platform, and FTC

6. DO A reverse image search of their photos (often stolen)

7. BLOCK them on all platforms

8. CONSIDER talking to a counselor - these scams cause real emotional harm

REAL STORY:

Patricia, a widow, met "David" on Facebook. He said he was a widowed engineer working in Malaysia. They talked every day for three months. He professed his love and promised to move to her town. Then he said his daughter had a medical emergency and needed $5,000. Patricia sent it via Western Union. Two weeks later, he needed $8,000 for a business license to leave Malaysia. She sent it. Then he disappeared. Patricia lost $13,000 and was heartbroken. The photos were of a real engineer who knew nothing about this.

RED FLAGS CHECKLIST:

• Never met face-to-face
• Asking for money (ANY amount)
• Too perfect, too interested, too quick
• Poor spelling/grammar despite claiming to be American
• Inconsistent details about their life
• Avoids video calls
• Pressures you to leave dating site for private email

REMEMBER:

Real love doesn't require money. Someone who truly cares will understand if you can't send money and won't ask in the first place. If you've never met someone in person, never send them money - no exceptions. These criminals are professionals at manipulation and target kind, lonely people. It's not your fault if this happens to you.

    readTime: 2,

HOW IT WORKS:

You receive exciting news: "Congratulations! You've won $2.5 million in the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes!" or "You're the lucky winner of our anniversary giveaway!" The message comes by phone, email, text, or even postal mail with official-looking documents.

There's just one small catch - you need to pay "processing fees," "taxes," or "insurance" before they can release your winnings. They make it sound routine and necessary. Once you pay, they disappear with your money.

WARNING SIGNS:

• You don't remember entering any contest or lottery
• Must pay fees, taxes, or insurance to claim prize
• Pressure to act immediately before offer expires
• Payment only via gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency
• Can't deduct fees from your winnings
• Asked to keep it secret
• Claims to be from Publishers Clearing House, HGTV, or other known brands
• Congratulatory letter or check that requires you to pay first

WHAT TO DO:

1. DO NOT pay any money

2. DO NOT give personal or banking information

3. DO NOT deposit checks they send (they're fake)

4. ASK yourself: Did I enter this contest? (If no, it's a scam)

5. REMEMBER: Legitimate prizes never require payment

6. DELETE the message or throw away the letter

7. REPORT to the FTC and the company being impersonated

IMPORTANT FACTS:

• Real sweepstakes don't require payment to win
• Legitimate taxes on prizes are paid when you file your tax return, not upfront
• You can't win a foreign lottery you didn't enter (and playing foreign lotteries by mail/phone is illegal)
• Publishers Clearing House NEVER asks winners to pay fees
• Real prize notifications come via certified mail or in-person, not email/text

REMEMBER:

If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Legitimate contests don't require you to pay anything to receive your prize. Think about it: if you really won millions of dollars, why would they need your $500? They could just deduct it from your winnings. The fact that they can't (and won't) is proof it's a scam.

    title: 'Tech Support Scam',

    readTime: 3,
    content: `
HOW IT WORKS:

You're working on your computer when a scary pop-up appears: "WARNING: Your computer has been infected with a virus!" with a phone number to call for "Microsoft Support" or "Apple Security." Or you receive an unexpected call from someone claiming to be from tech support saying they detected problems with your computer.

The scammer uses technical jargon to confuse you, shows you normal system files and claims they're viruses, or uses remote access to make fake "fixes." Then they charge hundreds of dollars for unnecessary "services" or install actual malware to steal your information.

WARNING SIGNS:

• Unsolicited phone call about your computer having problems
• Pop-up warning that won't close, with alarming sounds
• Claims to be from Microsoft, Apple, or your internet provider
• Asks for remote access to your computer
• Shows you "proof" of viruses using confusing computer screens
• Requests payment for fixing the "problem"
• Pressures you to act immediately
• Asks for credit card or bank account information
• Sells expensive "support plans" or "lifetime protection"

WHAT TO DO:

1. HANG UP immediately if they call you

2. CLOSE the pop-up window (force quit if needed - don't click anything in the pop-up)

3. RESTART your computer if you can't close the pop-up

4. DO NOT call phone numbers from pop-up warnings

5. DO NOT give remote access to your computer

6. DO NOT provide credit card information

7. RUN your own antivirus software (if you have it)

8. If you already gave access: Disconnect from internet, change passwords, call your bank

HOW TO CLOSE SCARY POP-UPS:

On Windows: Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, choose Task Manager, close your browser
On Mac: Press Command+Option+Esc, select browser, click Force Quit

IMPORTANT FACTS:

• Microsoft and Apple NEVER call customers about computer problems
• Real antivirus software doesn't hold your computer hostage with pop-ups
• Tech companies don't know if your specific computer has a virus
• Legitimate tech support doesn't cold-call people
• Real fixes don't cost hundreds of dollars

REMEMBER:

If your computer truly had a problem, your actual antivirus software would handle it quietly - not with scary pop-ups and phone numbers. Microsoft and Apple have millions of customers - they don't monitor individual computers and call people. If you need real tech help, contact a local computer repair shop you trust, ask a family member, or visit the actual company's website yourself.

DAILY SAFETY RULES:

Follow these simple rules to protect yourself from most scams. Print this list and keep it near your phone or computer!

1. VERIFY BEFORE YOU TRUST

The Golden Rule: If someone contacts YOU asking for money or information, always verify their identity through a separate method.

• Hang up and call the company/person back using a number YOU find
• Don't use phone numbers they provide - look it up yourself
• Type website addresses yourself - don't click links in emails
• Ask a trusted family member before making any financial decision
• Take 24 hours to think about any major decision

2. NEVER RUSH

Scammers create fake urgency to cloud your judgment. Real organizations give you time.

• "Act now or lose this opportunity" = SCAM
• "Your account will be closed today" = SCAM
• "Don't tell anyone about this" = SCAM
• Real problems can wait for you to verify the situation
• Take time to think clearly and check facts
• Sleep on major decisions

3. PAYMENT RED FLAGS

These payment methods are ALWAYS scams when requested by phone/email:

• Gift cards (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, etc.)
• Wire transfers (Western Union, MoneyGram)
• Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, etc.)
• Reloadable debit cards
• Shipping packages for others
• Payment apps to strangers (Venmo, Cash App)

Real businesses and government agencies NEVER ask for these payment methods!

4. PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Guard these like your house keys - NEVER share over phone/email:

• Social Security number
• Bank account and routing numbers
• Credit card numbers and CVV codes
• Online passwords or PINs
• Medicare number
• Date of birth
• Mother's maiden name

Legitimate organizations you do business with already have this information!

5. RECOGNIZE COMMON SCAM TACTICS

Watch for these manipulation techniques:

• Threats (arrest, account closure, benefits cancelled)
• Urgency (must act now, limited time, emergency)
• Secrecy (don't tell anyone, keep this confidential)
• Authority (claims to be government, police, bank)
• Emotion (fear, excitement, panic, love)
• Too good to be true (free prizes, guaranteed returns)

6. WHEN IN DOUBT

If something feels wrong, trust your instincts:

• Hang up the phone
• Close the email
• Don't respond to texts
• Ask a family member or friend
• Call the company directly using official contact info
• Use Elder Sentry to check suspicious messages
• Report to FTC: ReportFraud.ftc.gov

7. IF YOU'VE BEEN SCAMMED

Don't be embarrassed - these are professional criminals. Act quickly:

• Contact your bank/credit card company immediately
• Change passwords on all accounts
• Place fraud alert with credit bureaus
• Report to local police
• Report to FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov
• Tell a trusted family member
• Don't send more money to "fix" the situation

MOST IMPORTANT RULE:

It's better to miss a real opportunity than fall for a scam. No legitimate person or organization will be offended if you verify their identity or take time to think. Anyone who pressures you or gets angry when you want to verify is a scammer.

When in doubt, HANG UP, DELETE, or ASK FOR HELP!
